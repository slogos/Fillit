# Fillit
The Fillit project lets you discover and familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching for the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities. In this particular project you will learn how to create an algorithm which fits a set of Tetriminos together into the smallest possible square.

# How to run the program
1) make    
2) ./fillit test_file
